The project “Mobile Assistive Kit for Visually Impaired” is an embedded where all the hardware and software components been used and developed in it. The Presence of belt and mobile application has been reasoned out and placed very carefully. Hence the contributing to the best working unit for visually challenged has been designed perfectly. 
Secondly, using belt and mobile application for this project has been successfully implemented with a unique idea, successfully designed and tested. The advantage of this device is voice-based output for easy navigation i.e. the user gets the voice which gives the directions he needs to move to reach his destination. 
We develop a belt which will help these people to travel safely and autonomously. Most of the obstacles will be detected by the belt and the person shall receive a voice-based message as an output. The belt is activated by a mobile application which will make it easier for the blind person to operate the belt.
